# TVM - Vulnerability Remediation Scripts (PowerShell)

This repository stores PowerShell scripts designed to remediate vulnerabilities identified by a Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) program.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a centralized and version-controlled location for PowerShell scripts that automate the remediation of known vulnerabilities. This allows for:

* **Automation:** Streamlining the remediation process, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
* **Consistency:** Ensuring that remediation steps are applied uniformly across all affected systems.
* **Version Control:** Tracking changes to scripts and facilitating rollbacks if necessary.
* **Collaboration:** Enabling multiple team members to contribute to and improve remediation scripts.
* **Auditing:** Maintaining a record of remediation actions for compliance and reporting purposes.
